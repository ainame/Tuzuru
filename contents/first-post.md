# My First Blog Post

This is my very first blog post using Tuzuru! It's a static site generator written in Swift.

## What is Tuzuru?

Tuzuru is a simple but powerful static site generator that:

- Scans markdown files
- Gets author information from git history
- Converts markdown to HTML
- Uses Mustache templates for layout

Pretty cool, right?
